Compare performance of different versions of Test.SDK based on the reported times and wall-clock measurements. .NET Core 3.1 SDK is used as it is the most popular and will be for some time. There is very little we can do about improving the runner (vstest.console) part shipped with that SDK so this is solely focusing on the testhost and it's performance, as it is shipped by a nuget package and can be updated in any .NETCore project easily. 

# Usage

Just run `measure.ps1`. It requires a specific version of dotnet SDK, but you can change it in `global.json`, it might change your results, as different runner is shipped with different versions of SDK.

```powershell
$classes = 100
$tests = 100
$tries = 3 # try 1 will build the dll from scratch
```

## Adding new version of Test.SDK
To add new version do: 
```
mkdir Version16.9
cd Version16.9
dotnet new mstest
```

Then remove the `UnitTests1.cs` because the tests are generated. Open the new `.csproj`. Delete everything. Copy paste from some other `.csproj`. Change just the `Test.SDK` package version to align with the name of the folder. 

## Tries

Try 1 will actually compile the DLL, because we delete all obj and bin on the top of `measure.ps1`. This is on purpose, to easily see how long does that take, and to have it in the historical data. 

**BUT** it also means that try 1 is not comparable with the rest of the tries. So don't compare üçê with üçé.  

## History
Runs and logs are stored in history directory, with the data in JSON format for later analysis. Change the ObjectVersion on the json object if you change the data in it so it can be distinguished later.
